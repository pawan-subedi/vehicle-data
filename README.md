# vehicle-data
Fetches Vehicle Data from public api

It will take a really long time for the first load since it has to pull all the manufactures, their makes and models.
It is loaded into Cache so further load will be faster.

Usage

Clone the directory and run docker-compose up. Head out to localhost:8080.
